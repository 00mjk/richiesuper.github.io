                <h2>I wonder if being alive is worth it. I pretend to know many, many things, while in reality I know nothing. I pretend that I care about your opinions or stories, while in reality I don't care. I pretend being motivated, while in reality I'm just a person with no motivation, initiative, and hope. I am such a hopeless person. I don't love myself, yet I said that I loved my craft, such as this website page. I pretend that I have friends, while in reality I don't know if they really consider me as their friend. I pretend that I can be successful, yet I don't strive to be successful. I pretend that I have some hobbies, yet those hobbies are nothing more than my release mechanism, not something that I sincerely like or be passionate about. I pretend being smart, while in reality I'm just a stupid ass jerk. I am fed up with this bullshit. If I can wind back the time, I wish I had never been born at all... I miss that feeling where I don't feel anything. That blank feeling. That feeling that I can't describe. The feeling of not existing... That feeling of not being there. That feeling of nothingness. That feeling of pure bliss...</h2>
